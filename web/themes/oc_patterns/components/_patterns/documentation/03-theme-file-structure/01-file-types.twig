			<p>Pattern Lab components are made up of several file types:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>SCSS</li>
					<li>JS</li>
					<li>TWIG</li>
					<li>YML</li>
					<li>MD</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><strong>SCSS— </strong>SCSS files hold the SASS theming code that gets compiled into CSS for the site. <strong>SCSS files should never be visible to Pattern Lab and thus should always be preceded by an _.</strong> Each component generally gets its own .scss file even if it doesn't need any of the other file types. Some .scss files hold because they theme at a slightly higher level (example: _widgets.scss).</p>
			<p><strong>JS— </strong>JS files hold th Jquery scripts for the site. Most JS files should be hidden from Pattern Lab unless they are needed to test/demonstration specific component functionality. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Even if a JS file is visible to Pattern Lab, it will not be functional. It must also be included in theme/components/_meta/_01-foot.twig, assigned to a library in the theme's .libraries.yml and attached in a Twig template.</p>
			<p>JS files are attached to Twig templates (both in Drupal and Pattern Lab) through the {{ attach_library() }} Twig function. When a JS file is assigned to a library, it should also have its specific dependencies assigned.</p>
