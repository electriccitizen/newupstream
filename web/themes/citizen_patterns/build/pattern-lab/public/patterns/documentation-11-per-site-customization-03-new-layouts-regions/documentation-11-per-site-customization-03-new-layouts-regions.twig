			<p>New layouts can be created as needed to fit the design (although a lot of designs can be completed with the One column default layout and the pre-made Two Column Sidebar layout. <strong>Never delete any existing layouts without knowing that they are unused.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>New Layout Templates—</strong> New Layouts need two templates. The first is a Pattern Lab template. This should be created by adding a new folder in 04-pages/layouts (using an index number) and adding a .twig and .scss file for the template. Regions should be set in region divs with aria roles as blocks that can be replaced when this template is inherited into Drupal. Region placeholder divs are used in PL to provide styling structure. The Scss file can be used to style the layout region placement in Pattern Lab so you can see a visual representation of it before its used in Drupal.</p>
			<p>The Drupal template is created in the zzz-custom/layout folder. This template inherits the Pattern Lab template and replaces the region placeholder div with the content.regionname Drupal region variable. 
			<p><strong>Registering New Layouts—</strong> In order for new layouts to be found by Layout Builder, they must be registered in citizen_patterns.layouts.yml. Enter the template information in the same format as the existing templates. Cache must be cleared afterward.</p>
			<p><strong>Changing the Citizen Pattern default block layout regions—</strong> The default Citizen Patterns block layout template has regions for Header, Content, Pre-footer and Footer. Sometimes it is necessary to add a new region to this layout. This can be done be entering the new region in citizen_patterns.info.yml. Unused regions should be removed on a per-site basis. Cache must be cleared afterward.</p>
