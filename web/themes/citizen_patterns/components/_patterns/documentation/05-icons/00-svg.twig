			<p>OC Patterns uses a lot of icons for each site. Most of those icons are brought in as background styles from a gulp generate svg sprite. <strong>All icons on the site should be SVG icons unless there is an absolute need to not use SVG.</strong> SVG icons should be loaded into the unless they absolute do not work as a square.</p>
			<p>The SVG sprite is generated by the <span class="code">gulp theme</span> run as part of <span class="code">npm start</span>. Any svg files found in theme/images/icons/src will be added to the sprite. <strong>All icons added to the sprite must be 80x80px.</strong> This size is set in the local.gulp-config.js iconConfig function.</p> The sprite needs to have exactly the same sizing for each icon in order to automatically construct its background-positioning with the sprite.</p>
			<p>If you need use an SVG icon that is not a square, you can add it in theme/images/svg and manually call it as a background image and set the dimensions and positioning.</p>
			<p>SVG Icons that are set using HTMl SVG tag directly in Twig (example: social media widget icons) that are part of the SVG sprite need to have their viewbox position set. This is done through use of a <a href="#macros-overview">macro</a> in 00-base/global/05-macros/macros.twig. This position will need to be reset each time the sprite is regenerated.</p>
			<p>The <span class="code">gulp theme</span> task will automatically create a css class and a background mixin in 01-atoms/04-images/icons/_icon_sprite.scss for each icon in the sprite. This file should not be altered in any way. Each icon added to the sprite should also be manually added to the icons.yml file in this same folder. This will allow the icon to be displayed in Pattern Lab.</p>
